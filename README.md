I wrote this game while studying Javascript to help me practice touch-typing symbols. I also implemented a quiz feature similar to flash cards so that the JSON file could be updated with concepts from my study.

The basic game is to type 4 lines of text and match them to their definitions. Answers are selected by typing the symbol next to it. Points are based on speed, accuracy, and correct answers.

This was originally built to run from a node.js server, but has been striped down to run locally. **To play, simply open index.html in a browser.** Window width must be 800+ and allow javascript.
